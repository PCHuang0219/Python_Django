            This unique End-to-End Network Demo highlights the interoperability of TIP technologies – OpenRAN, vRAN Fronthaul, Edge Computing, Disaggregated Cell Site Gateways (DCSG), Cassini, Crowdcell, & OpenCellular – with cutting-edge new vendors. Together, this suite of telecom solutions utilizes a software-centric, vendor-neutral approach showcasing the value of disaggregation and the power of interoperability for more agile networks at lower cost.

            <p class="content_solution">
                Showcasing the interoperability of these technologies, this demonstration utilizes general purpose processing platforms and white box devices to establish the key components necessary for a telecommunications network – from core, to transport, and RAN. This disaggregated approach allows for greater flexibility, capitalizing on the strengths of each component. To adapt to available transmission, the network can utilize either vRAN for constrained fronthaul and OpenRAN for unconstrained fronthaul. As DCSG aggregates incoming traffic from the radio access network, Cassini focuses on transporting the traffic up to the Core. Both OpenCellular and CrowdCell complement this basic framework, each offering unique capabilities: OpenCellular for cost effective, rural deployment, and Crowdcell for coverage extension through relay functionalities. Edge Computing optimizes traffic management, allowing selected content to be delivered more efficiently, decreasing latency and transport costs, and enabling new applications and services.
