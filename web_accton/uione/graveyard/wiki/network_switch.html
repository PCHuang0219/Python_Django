                            A network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge[1]) is a computer
                            networking device that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to
                            receive, process, and forward data to the destination device. A network switch is a multiport
                            network bridge that uses hardware addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer
                            (layer 2) of the OSI model. Some switches can also process data at the network layer (layer 3) by
                            additionally incorporating routing functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3
                            switches or multilayer switches.[2] Switches for Ethernet are the most common form of network
                            switch. The first Ethernet switch was introduced by Kalpana in 1990.[3] Switches also exist for
                            other types of networks including Fibre Channel, Asynchronous Transfer Mode, and InfiniBand.
                            Unlike less advanced repeater hubs, which broadcast the same data out of each of its ports and let
                            the devices decide what data they need, a network switch forwards data only to the devices that
                            need to receive it.[4]</br>

                                A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data
                                cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.
                                Switches manage the flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet only
                                to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each networked device connected to a
                                switch can be identified by its network address, allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic
                                maximizing the security and efficiency of the network.</br>
                                A switch is more intelligent than an Ethernet hub, which simply retransmits packets out of every
                                port of the hub except the port on which the packet was received, unable to distinguish different
                                recipients, and achieving an overall lower network efficiency.</br>
                                An Ethernet switch operates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to create a separate
                                collision domain for each switch port. Each device connected to a switch port can transfer data to
                                any of the other ports at any time and the transmissions will not interfere.[a] Because broadcasts
                                are still being forwarded to all connected devices by the switch, the newly formed network segment
                                continues to be a broadcast domain. Switches may also operate at higher layers of the OSI model,
                                including the network layer and above. A device that also operates at these higher layers is known
                                as a multilayer switch.</br>
                                Segmentation involves the use of a switch to split a larger collision domain into smaller ones in
                                order to reduce collision probability, and to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme
                                case (i.e. micro-segmentation), each device is located on a dedicated switch port. In contrast to
                                an Ethernet hub, there is a separate collision domain on each of the switch ports. This allows
                                computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run
                                in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per collision
                                domain, making collisions impossible.</br>
                                The network switch plays an integral role in most modern Ethernet local area networks (LANs).
                                Mid-to-large sized LANs contain a number of linked managed switches. Small office/home office
                                (SOHO) applications typically use a single switch, or an all-purpose device such as a residential
                                gateway to access small office/home broadband services such as DSL or cable Internet. In most of
                                these cases, the end-user device contains a router and components that interface to the particular
                                physical broadband technology. User devices may also include a telephone interface for Voice over
                                IP (VoIP).</br>

                            <h3>Role in a network</h3>
                            <p class="font1">
                                Switches are most commonly used as the network connection point for hosts at the edge of a
                                network. In the hierarchical internetworking model and similar network architectures, switches are
                                also used deeper in the network to provide connections between the switches at the edge.</br>
                                In switches intended for commercial use, built-in or modular interfaces make it possible to
                                connect different types of networks, including Ethernet, Fibre Channel, RapidIO, ATM, ITU-T G.hn
                                and 802.11. This connectivity can be at any of the layers mentioned. While the layer-2
                                functionality is adequate for bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting
                                technologies such as Ethernet and token ring is performed more easily at layer 3 or via
                                routing.[6] Devices that interconnect at the layer 3 are traditionally called routers, so layer 3
                                switches can also be regarded as relatively primitive and specialized routers.[7]</br>
                                Where there is a need for a great deal of analysis of network performance and security, switches
                                may be connected between WAN routers as places for analytic modules. Some vendors provide
                                firewall,[8][9] network intrusion detection,[10] and performance analysis modules that can plug
                                into switch ports. Some of these functions may be on combined modules.[11]</br>
                                Through port mirroring, a switch can create a mirror image of data that can go to an external
                                device such as intrusion detection systems and packet sniffers. </br>
                                A modern switch may implement
                                power over Ethernet (PoE), which avoids the need for attached devices, such as a VoIP phone or
                                wireless access point, to have a separate power supply. Since switches can have redundant power
                                circuits connected to uninterruptible power supplies, the connected device can continue operating
                                even when regular office power fails.</br>
